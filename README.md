- ✅ **Enhanced video/audio processing** with configurable settings
- ✅ **FPS selection** (15/30/45/60 FPS) in video menu with GaugeIcon
- ✅ **Audio optimization** (disabled echo cancellation, auto gain control, noise suppression)
- ⚠️ **Single monitor optimized** (dual monitor has coordinate limitations)
- ✅ **Update functionality removed** for lightweight operation
- ✅ **Serial port support** for keyboard/mouse capture (full KVM functionality)
- ✅ **Seamless FPS switching** without video disconnection
- ✅ **Clean production code** (all console.log removed)

## Improvements Over ARM64 Version

Unlike the ARM64 fork which had serialport compatibility issues, this Win32 version:
